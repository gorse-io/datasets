Gorse is an open-source recommendation system written in Go. Gorse aims to be a universal open-source recommender system that can be easily introduced into a wide variety of online services. By importing items, users and interaction data into Gorse, the system will automatically train models to generate recommendations for each user.

# Quick Start

The playground mode has been prepared for beginners. Just set up a recommender system for GitHub repositories by following the commands.

::: code-tabs#setup

@tab:active Bash

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gorse.io/playground | bash
```

@tab Docker

```bash
docker run -p 8088:8088 zhenghaoz/gorse-in-one --playground
```

:::

The playground mode will download data from [GitRec][gitrec] and import it into Gorse. The dashboard is available at http://localhost:8088.

After the "Find neighbors of items" task is completed on the "Tasks" page, try to insert several feedbacks into Gorse. Suppose Bob is a frontend developer who starred several frontend repositories in GitHub. We insert his star feedback to Gorse.

::: code-tabs#example

@tab:active HTTP

```bash
read -d '' JSON << EOF
[
    { \"FeedbackType\": \"star\", \"UserId\": \"bob\", \"ItemId\": \"vuejs:vue\", \"Timestamp\": \"2022-02-24\" },
    { \"FeedbackType\": \"star\", \"UserId\": \"bob\", \"ItemId\": \"d3:d3\", \"Timestamp\": \"2022-02-25\" },
    { \"FeedbackType\": \"star\", \"UserId\": \"bob\", \"ItemId\": \"dogfalo:materialize\", \"Timestamp\": \"2022-02-26\" },
    { \"FeedbackType\": \"star\", \"UserId\": \"bob\", \"ItemId\": \"mozilla:pdf.js\", \"Timestamp\": \"2022-02-27\" },
    { \"FeedbackType\": \"star\", \"UserId\": \"bob\", \"ItemId\": \"moment:moment\", \"Timestamp\": \"2022-02-28\" }
]
EOF

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8088/api/feedback \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d "$JSON"
```

@tab Go

```bash
```

@tab Python

```bash
```

@tab TypeScript

```bash
```

@tab Rust

```bash
```

@tab Java

```bash
```

:::

Then, fetch 10 recommended items from Gorse. We can find that frontend-related repositories are recommended for Bob.

::: code-tabs#example

@tab:active HTTP

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8088/api/recommend/bob?n=10
```

@tab Go

```bash
```

@tab Python

```bash
```

@tab TypeScript

```bash
```

@tab Rust

```bash
```

@tab Java

```bash
```

:::

```json
[
  "mbostock:d3",
  "nt1m:material-framework",
  "mdbootstrap:vue-bootstrap-with-material-design",
  "justice47:f2-vue",
  "10clouds:cyclejs-cookie",
  "academicpages:academicpages.github.io",
  "accenture:alexia",
  "addyosmani:tmi",
  "1wheel:d3-starterkit",
  "acdlite:redux-promise"
]
```
